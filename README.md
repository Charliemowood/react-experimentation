This is a very simple card revealing game using React and webpack. 

To view the project run the following commands in Terminal. 

1. Install the relevant packages:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the server:
  ```bash
  nodemon server.js
  ```
3. Start webpack:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
4. Open localhost in your browser:
  ```bash
  localhost:3000
  ```
